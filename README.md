# Analysis exercise sheets

Waterproof is educational software designed to help students with learning the skill of proving mathematical statements. It uses a natural syntax See [here](https://impermeable.github.io/) for more information.

This repository contains exercise sheets for the [Analysis](https://ocasys.rug.nl/current/catalog/course/WBMA012-05) course at the University of Groningen.

## Tutorial

This repository also contains an edited version of the Waterproof tutorial, `tutorial.mv`, which explains how to use Waterproof's custom proof language with very simple examples.

# Quickstart

## Quickstart (in browser)

You can try out these exercises in Github codespaces, which is a service that offers a free number of hours per month. To open the exercises in Github codespaces, you can click on the following link.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/mseri/waterproof-analysis?quickstart=1)

This link should give you the option of continuing in an earlier opened workspace, if you have opened these exercises in codespaces before.

Tip: make sure you close your Github codespace environment after using it.

## Quickstart (local)

1. Download the [exercises](https://github.com/mseri/waterproof-analysis/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip them in a new folder.
2. Go to [https://vscode.dev?enable-coi](https://vscode.dev?enable-coi) using Google Chrome or Chromium.
3. Go to extensions (Ctrl+Shift+x or Cmd+Shift+x), search for Waterproof and install it (choose to "trust" the extension).
4. Go to files (Ctrl+Shift+e or Cmd+Shift+x), click "Open folder" and choose the folder from step 1 (choose to "trust" the folder).
5. If the browser asks for permission to view or edit files in that location,
allow this.
6. Open the relevant `.mv` file, for instance `tutorial.mv`.
7. If everything installed correctly, you should see a "Goal" window on the right, which shows what is left to prove when you click in the text of proofs.
